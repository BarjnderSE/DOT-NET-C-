## .NET MVC Projects

### What is .NET MVC?
ASP.NET MVC (Model-View-Controller) is a framework for building web applications in .NET. It follows the MVC design pattern, which separates the application into three components:
- **Model:** Manages the data and business logic.
- **View:** Handles the display of the UI.
- **Controller:** Processes user input and interacts with the Model to display the correct View.

### My Experience with .NET MVC
I have created several projects using the .NET MVC framework, connected with **Entity Framework** and **T-SQL** for database operations. These projects involved:
- **CRUD Operations:** Implementing Create, Read, Update, and Delete functionality.
- **Frontend Templates:** Using pre-designed templates to create user-friendly interfaces.
- **Entity Framework:** Leveraging EF for database interaction and object-relational mapping.

### Projects I Have Worked On
Here are some of the projects I built using .NET MVC:
1. **Book Store:** An online book store with full CRUD functionality.
2. **Coffee Shop:** A coffee shop management system.
3. **E-Bike Store:** A web application for browsing and managing bike sales.
4. **Klinic:** A clinic management system.
5. **BlogMe:** A blog application for creating and managing posts.

### What I Learned
- Basics of MVC architecture and its separation of concerns.
- How to use **Entity Framework** for database interaction.
- Performing **CRUD operations** using **T-SQL**.
- Integrating templates for responsive and clean user interfaces.
- Connecting the frontend with backend functionality.

### What I Am Learning
- Advanced Entity Framework features (e.g., migrations, LINQ queries).
- Securing applications with authentication and authorization.
- Optimizing performance and scalability in .NET applications.

These projects are part of my journey to learn and grow as a developer. I'm eager to dive deeper into the .NET ecosystem and build more advanced applications.
